# pf1_Bestiary
This is a collection of monsters for the pathfinder game system, intended for use on the Foundry virtual tabletop. Using a combination of the stat block converter (https://github.com/Lavaeolous/PF1-StatBlock-Converter-Module) and the Foundry VTT data-toolbox (https://github.com/SvenWerlen/fvtt-data-toolbox).

However this repo will contain just the db for simplicity and easy integration into foundry.


### Note: You can find the original stat block in the notes tab for double-checking values
